# GPU-Registerfile-Virtualization

This is a GPU register file virtualization code that was developed based on GPGPU-Sim for

Hyeran Jeon, Gokul Subramanian Ravi, Nam Sung Kim, and Murali Annavaram, "GPGPU Register File Virtualization," The 48th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), Waikiki, Hawaii, December 2015 (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2830784)


* Compilation & Execution: The same with GPGPU-Sim

* Sample configuration: sample_gpgpusim.config

* How can I turn off register file virtualization? : By commenting out -DRENAMING in the Makefiles.

* Expected simulation outputs: 
You can check the register file virtualization statistics under the following keywords in the simulation output file:

-total physical register allocated = 2672127    // total number of physical registers used

-total arch register allocated = 5301100        // total number of architected registers used

-max physical register allocated = 247          // peak number of physical registers allocated

-max arch register allocated = 288              // peak number of architected registers allocated

-total phys subarray utils  = 21889             // physical register subarray utilization

-total arch subarray utils  = 33366             // architectural register subarray utilization

-gpu_reg_rename_table_access = 851056           // total number of accesses to renaming table
